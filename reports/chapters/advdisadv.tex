\section{Considerations}

\subsection{Disadvantages}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Firstly, I would like to point out the limitation of the data used. Even though
          it is not the problem with the overall approach, it is worth mentioning. In
          particular, the dataset has the genre imbalance as can be seen on
          figure~\ref{fig:dataanalysis:genre_distr}, which is pretty important issue, but
          is not addressed in this work.
    \item One of the main limitations of \textit{GNN} is the inability of distinguishing
          the different structures of the graphs. This issue is related to the graph
          isomorphism. It is hard to say whether this concrete limitation affecting the
          problem we are trying to solve. However, since we are considering graph
          structures, we need to take into consideration every possible issue. Moreover,
          one of the possible solutions if \textit{Graph Isomorphism
              Network}~\cite{xuHowPowerfulAre2019}
    \item I do not see any point in considering noise vulnerability of the \textit{GNN}s,
          since this issue is clearly not related to the problem considered.
    \item Furthermore, \textit{GNN}s suffer from time-space complexity issues. It is very
          difficult to scale such a network. Number of edges in dense graph can reach up
          to \(O(n^2)\). Therefore, all the computations difficulty and space
          requirenments raise drastically.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Advantages}

\begin{itemize}
    \item If the data represented in the natural for it form (i.e.~graphs), it allows to
          capture difficult connections between the data nodes. Learning from not the
          data itself, but the connections as well, allows for better accuracy and
          overally better results.
    \item Moreover, natural representation of the data increases the interpretability of
          the processes behind the scenes, as well as, the interpretability of the final
          results.
    \item The overall generality of the approach allows to apply the theory to a wide
          variety of the problems. Since many real-world structures can be respresented
          as graphs, different interpretations are possible.
          \begin{enumerate}
              \item Convolution
              \item Attention
              \item LSTM
              \item RNN
              \item CV
              \item and many others
          \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}
