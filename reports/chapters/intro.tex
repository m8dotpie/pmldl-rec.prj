\section{Introduction}

In this work we will consider the development of a movie recommender system.
Given the information about the user and his movie preferences, the neural
network should suggest good movies to watch.

Generally, the work should provide a good overview of \textit{Graph Neural
    Networks} and \textit{Graph Convolutional Networks} in particular.

Moreover, we will briefly cover several questions regarding recommender
systems:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Negative sampling
    \item Loss functions
    \item Recommeder system metrics
\end{itemize}
